# My Ruby Project

Trying to develop with ruby in a reproducable development environment.

## Notes

- Sinatra needs to be bound to '0.0.0.0' to be available outside the local machine, default behaviour is to be bound to localhost only.
- Vagrant needs the vbguest plugin to mount files properly
- Remember to use `apt-get install **-y**`.
